TeeTyme is a user-interface by which an administrator of a golfing resort can create,
maintain, and delete aspects of their resort. Admins will be able to make changes to
players, courses, and each game that players have played per course. The login system
can be used to offer security to the resort's data. As of now, registration to login is
open, however it can be modified to only allow administrator login once that decision
has been made. It is the intention of the TeeTyme creators to create an easy to use,
secure, and convenient process for all golf resort system maintenance.
